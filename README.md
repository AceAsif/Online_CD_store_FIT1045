# Online_CD_store_FIT1045
I wrote a python program for an on-line CD store. My program can create a list of records about CDs by reading the data from a file (CD_Store.txt file is provided). The program will then display a menu that allows the user to
sort the list by different attributes of the CDs or search for CDs based on these attributes until the user elects to quit. Also there is a pdf file for the assignment description. 
It is fully working and I got a HD for this assignment.
